## Overview

## Usage
## Acknowledgements
The author frequently referred to, and adapted, the unit tests in the [Exercism Bash Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/bash). Many thanks to the authors of those tests for their work, particularly, the clarity of test names, and the addition of extra tests.

Thanks to JPSoftware for making [_TCC-RT_](https://jpsoft.com/downloads/v25/tcc-rt.exe) freely available, so enabling learners around the world to experience the power of this command language via a learning resource such as a _TCC-RT_-based Exercism track.

Many thanks, also, to Rex C. Conn, and to Tom Rawson, for authoring [_4DOS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4DOS) back in 1989, so commencing the journey that has led to today's [_TCC_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Command_Console) and _TCC-RT_.

## TODO
Assuming acceptance of this proposal, commence working on the newly-created repositories:

`https://github.com/exercism/tccrt`

and:

`https://github.com/exercism/tccrt-test-runner`

The author expects to effect the transference of current repository contents to the new track.

However, should there be interest, welcomes contributions in the form of new exercises. These should be quite straightforward to implement since committed exercises may be used as templates.
